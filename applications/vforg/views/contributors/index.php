        </li>
        <li>With respect to any patents you own, or that you can license without

            <ul>

                <li>at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties

                arrangements.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in your

        took place before the date you sign these terms. Any contribution we make
        available under any license will also be made available under a suitable
        FSF (Free Software Foundation) or OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved
